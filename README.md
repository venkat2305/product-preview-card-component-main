# learnings

media queries
responsive images
Use picture element to switch between the images when screen size changes:
use Semantic HTML markup wherever you can to make app more accessible
<img> tags, used to include images on a document, require an alt attribute to describe the contents of the image. This is essential for users that cannot see the image (like screen reader users), or as an alternate text when the image cannot be displayed.
use forward slashes not backslash in the path of image tags. if we copy paste relative path it uses backward slashes.

# to do
responsive images
srcset
picture tag to change images responsively

# follow these
You can only use <main> if you don't need the others. The most important thing is elements like <div> shouldn't be direct descendants of <body>.
images forward slash
document should have atleast one h1 tag
html document should have main element
wirte alt attribute for images
