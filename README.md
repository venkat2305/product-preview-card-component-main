# learnings

media queries
responsive images
Use picture element to switch between the images when screen size changes:
use Semantic HTML markup wherever you can to make app more accessible
<img> tags, used to include images on a document, require an alt attribute to describe the contents of the image. This is essential for users that cannot see the image (like screen reader users), or as an alternate text when the image cannot be displayed.
use forward slashes not backslash in the path of image tags. if we copy paste relative path it uses backward slashes.
